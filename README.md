This is my attempt at recreating the classic video game, Snake!

## What is Snake? 
Snake is the common name for a videogame concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length, with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade. 
  #### Gameplay
  The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward, it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving 
  snake. In some games, the end of the trail is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another common 
  scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number of units away from the head. The player loses when the 
  snake runs into the screen border, a trail or other obstacle, or itself.

## Libraries used 
I built this game using HTML & CSS (obviously), and with a little help from a powerful processing library, p5.JS[https://p5js.org/]
